# Reddit-Chegg-Bot
Not fully functional. Operates a chegg account to provide reddit users with subscription-only answers 

Currently, it's able to extract the links and interactively message the reddit users, but I decided to stop this project due to Chegg's anti-scraping measures. The Paypal invoice generator isn't bundled with this either, but there's plenty of open source paypal bots.
